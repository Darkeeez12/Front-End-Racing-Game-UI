Responsive Racing Game Dashboard UI
---

This project is a comprehensive, multi-page front-end user interface for a racing game dashboard. It was meticulously designed to provide a modern and immersive user experience with a strong emphasis on visual consistency and responsive behavior across all devices.
Project Highlights

    Figma Design & Prototyping: Designed the entire interface in Figma, taking inspiration from the visuals of games like Asphalt Legends. The design focuses on being easy to use on phones first, with clear navigation and a smooth user experience.

    Responsive Front-End Development: Translated the Figma prototypes into a fully responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project maintains pixel-perfect accuracy on both desktop and mobile screens, ensuring a consistent and polished user experience.

    JavaScript Functionality: I implemented fully validated sign-up and login features using JavaScript, demonstrating an understanding of front-end logic and secure user input handling.
